#Notes

The concert-this works some of the time, but not always. I don't know what is causing the errors for some artists. I was getting data back without errors for any artist, however I could not parse the data so I did not use this method. 
I was unable to figure out how to use moment.js and could not format the date differently for the concert-this.
